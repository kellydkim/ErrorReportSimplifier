This is the development (dev) branch for our project, ErrorReportSimplifier (name in progress).

In this branch, we'll be testing development.  These builds are not guaranteed to be stable - check
the master branch for tested, stable builds. 

This project will take in an input file (starting with .json) and ask the user to filter out
any sort of unwanted tags to make for easier parsing and reading via customized output files.
